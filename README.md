# DeliveryRobot

## Overview

This repository contains the project "DeliveryRobot," which is part of the book "Eloquent JavaScript."

## Project: A Robot

In the "project" chapters of the book, the focus shifts from theoretical concepts to practical application. These chapters are dedicated to working through a program together, emphasizing the importance of both understanding theory and reading actual code.

### The Automaton Project

In this chapter, the project involves building an automaton - a small program that performs tasks in a virtual world. Our specific task is to create a mail-delivery robot. This robot's function is to navigate a virtual environment, picking up and delivering parcels.
